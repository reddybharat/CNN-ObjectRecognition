# ObjectDetection
End-to-End model for object detection

The model uses pytorch library for doing all the necessary creation, training and deployment of the model. The CNN model architecture is illustrated in the png file included with this repository. To predict object in a image, just feed the url of the jpg link and the output will be displayed. The model with enough training can achieve an accuracy of 74%. To know more about the algorithms in the model refer to pytorch manual.
